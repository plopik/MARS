MARS
====

Modular Automated (for) Reddit Script

MARS is a customizable reddit script that is built in "modules". The purpose of the modular design is to allow for quick repurposing of the entire script based on the needs of the person or subreddit that is using MARS. Another benefit of the modular design is knowing exactly where to look when an error occurs. Future versions of MARS will allow the script to sacrifice a module to retain process stability.

For information on how to use MARS, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/PixelOrange/MARS/wiki).
